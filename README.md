# Incident Response Simulation

## 📌 Project Overview
A simulated phishing-to-ransomware incident was conducted in my student lab to practice the NIST IR lifecycle: Identify, Contain, Eradicate, Recover.

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
- Sysmon + Splunk/Wazuh
- Wireshark
- VM snapshots

## 🎯 Objectives
- Design and simulate an incident scenario
- Detect and investigate suspicious activity
- Follow NIST IR phases
- Produce an IR report and playbook

## 📝 Deliverables
- IR timeline (events + logs)
- IR report (PDF in /reports)
- Playbook (Markdown/PDF)
- Blog article link: [Coming Soon]

## 🚀 How to Reproduce
1. Simulate phishing email + malicious file in VM  
2. Capture logs via Sysmon/Wireshark  
3. Analyze with SIEM dashboards  
4. Document IR lifecycle steps  

## 📸 Screenshots
(Add SIEM alerts + IR report snippets)
